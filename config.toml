Mahtab's stories, music, and smile, are a moral compass and guide for Theora over the next two decades of her life as she finds the answers to the mystery of who she is. Why was she brought to Tanzania? What are the strange symbols tattooed on her wrist? Who really were her parents? She learns through pain, fear, loss, and love, who she really is, and who she wants to be."
